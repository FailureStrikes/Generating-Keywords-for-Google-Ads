# Generating-Keywords-for-Google-Ads

In this guided project, I used Python to create a list of keywords for a search engine marketing campaign.I combined product names with appropriate words to ensure the ads were relevant to user queries..
After that, organized the keywords and mapped them to the right ads, directing users to appropriate landing pages.Then, converted the list of keywords into a Pandas DataFrame and exported it to a CSV file for further uses.

Overall, the project involved generating relevant keywords, organizing them effectively, and analyzing and exporting the data for use in a search engine marketing campaign.
